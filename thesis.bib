abstract = "Swarm robotics is concerned with the decentralised coordination of multiple robots having only limited communication and interaction abilities. Although fault tolerance and robustness to individual robot failures have often been used to justify the use of swarm robotic systems, recent studies have shown that swarm robotic systems are susceptible to certain types of failure. In this paper we propose an approach to self-healing swarm robotic systems and take inspiration from the process of granuloma formation, a process of containment and repair found in the immune system. We use a case study of a swarm performing team work where previous works have demonstrated that partially failed robots have the most detrimental effect on overall swarm behaviour. We have developed an immune inspired approach that permits the recovery from certain failure modes during operation of the swarm, overcoming issues that effect swarm behaviour associated with partially failed robots."

  abstract =	 {From bird flocks to fish schools, animal groups
                  often seem to react to environmental perturbations
                  as if of one mind. Most studies in collective animal
                  behavior have aimed to understand how a globally
                  ordered state may emerge from simple behavioral
                  rules. Less effort has been devoted to understanding
                  the origin of collective response, namely the way
                  the group as a whole reacts to its environment. Yet,
                  in the presence of strong predatory pressure on the
                  group, collective response may yield a significant
                  adaptive advantage. Here we suggest that collective
                  response in animal groups may be achieved through
                  scale-free behavioral correlations. By
                  reconstructing the 3D position and velocity of
                  individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we
                  measured to what extent the velocity fluctuations of
                  different birds are correlated to each other. We
                  found that the range of such spatial correlation
                  does not have a constant value, but it scales with
                  the linear size of the flock. This result indicates
                  that behavioral correlations are scale free: The
                  change in the behavioral state of one animal affects
                  and is affected by that of all other animals in the
                  group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free
                  correlations provide each animal with an effective
                  perception range much larger than the direct
                  interindividual interaction range, thus enhancing
                  global response to perturbations. Our results
                  suggest that flocks behave as critical systems,
                  poised to respond maximally to environmental
                  perturbations.},

  abstract =	 {In this paper, we introduce a method for determining
                  local interaction rules in animal swarms. The method
                  is based on the assumption that the behavior of
                  individuals in a swarm can be treated as a set of
                  mechanistic rules.The principal idea behind the
                  technique is to vary parameters that define a set of
                  hypothetical interactions, as for example, a rule
                  for aligning with neighbors. The parameter values
                  are optimized so that the deviation between the
                  observed movements in an animal swarm and the
                  movements predicted by the assumed rule set is
                  minimal. We demonstrate the method by reconstructing
                  the interaction rules from the trajectories produced
                  by a computer simulation.},

  abstract =	 "Designing and analyzing self-organizing systems such
                  as robotic swarms is a challenging task even though
                  we have complete knowledge about the robot's
                  interior. It is difficult to determine the
                  individual robot's behavior based on the swarm
                  behavior and vice versa due to the high number of
                  agent--agent interactions. A step towards a solution
                  of this problem is the development of appropriate
                  models which accurately predict the swarm behavior
                  based on a specified control algorithm. Such models
                  would reduce the necessary number of time-consuming
                  simulations and experiments during the design
                  process of an algorithm. In this paper we propose a
                  model with focus on an explicit representation of
                  space because the effectiveness of many swarm
                  robotic scenarios depends on spatial
                  inhomogeneity. We use methods of statistical physics
                  to address spatiality. Starting from a description
                  of a single robot we derive an abstract model of
                  swarm motion. The model is then extended to a
                  generic model framework of communicating robots. In
                  two examples we validate models against simulation
                  results. Our experience shows that qualitative
                  correctness is easily achieved, while quantitative
                  correctness is disproportionately more difficult but
                  still possible.",

  abstract =	 {Many ants use pheromone trails to organize
                  collective foraging. This study investigated the
                  rate at which a well-established
                  Pharaoh{\textquestiondown}s ant, Monomorium
                  pharaonis (L.), trail breaks down on two substrates
                  (polycarbonate plastic, newspaper). Workers were
                  allowed to feed on sucrose solution from a feeder 30
                  cm from the nest. Between the nest and the feeder,
                  the trail had a Y-shaped bifurcation. Initially,
                  while recruiting to and exploiting the feeder,
                  workers could only deposit pheromone on the branch
                  leading to the feeder. Once the trail was
                  established (by approximately 60 ants per min for 20
                  min), the ants were not allowed to reinforce the
                  trail and were given a choice between the marked and
                  unmarked branches. The numbers of ants choosing each
                  branch were counted for 30 min. Initially, most went
                  to the side on which pheromone had been deposited
                  (80\% and 70\% on the plastic and paper substrates,
                  respectively). However, this decayed to 50\% within
                  25 min for plastic and 8 min for paper. From these
                  data, the half-life times of the pheromone are
                  estimated as approximately 9 min and 3 min on
                  plastic and paper, respectively. The results show
                  that, for M. pharaonis, trail decay is rapid and is
                  affected strongly by trail substrate}

  abstract =	 {An investigation of the predator-evasion behaviour
                  of minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) shoals confronted with
                  a pike (Esox lucius) showed that individual minnows
                  generally chose the behaviour that minimized their
                  chance of being eaten by the predator. As soon as
                  the pike had been detected, minnows switched from
                  dispersed small shoals to a single compact
                  school. They then commenced inspection behaviour,
                  during which individuals or groups approached the
                  predator. This inspection served to confirm
                  recognition of the pike and provide information on
                  its behaviour. Avoidance and skittering behaviour
                  took place when the pike began stalking. It was only
                  when the predator escalated its attack and struck at
                  the shoal that the minnows performed their most
                  costly predator evasion tactics, such as flash
                  expansion and fountain. After such tactics
                  individuals often became separated from the shoal
                  and as such were most vulnerable to capture. As a
                  last resort, individual minnows hid among
                  stones. Minnows from provenances with and without
                  pike exhibited a similar repertoire of antipredator
                  behaviour patterns, but those sympatric with the
                  predator integrated their tactics more effectively
                  and regained pre-exposure behaviour sooner after
                  each encounter. Shoal size had an important effect
                  on the execution of tactics. Minnows in shoals of 10
                  were more likely than minnows in shoals of 20 or 50
                  to abandon schooling behaviour and seek cover as
                  individuals.},

                  the exchange of long-range information necessary to
                  control their density remains unknown. We show that
                  large flocks self-organize to the maximum density at
                  which a typical individual still can see out of the
                  flock in many directions. Such flocks are marginally
                  opaque—an external observer also still can see a
                  substantial fraction of sky through the
                  flock. Although this seems intuitive, we show it
                  need not be the case; flocks might easily be highly
                  diffuse or entirely opaque. The emergence of
                  marginal opacity strongly constrains how individuals
                  interact with one another within large swarms. It
                  also provides a mechanism for global interactions:
                  an individual can respond to the projection of the
                  flock that it sees. This provides for faster
                  information transfer and hence rapid flock dynamics,
                  another advantage over local models. From a
                  behavioral perspective, it optimizes the information
                  available to each bird while maintaining the
                  protection of a dense, coherent flock.},

                  decisions that affect the entire group? Evidence
                  collected from schooling animals suggests that the
                  process is somewhat democratic, with nearest
                  neighbors and the majority shaping overall
                  collective behavior. In animals with hierarchical
                  social structures such as primates or wolves,
                  however, such democracy may be complicated by
                  dominance. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. monitored all
                  the individuals within a baboon troop continuously
                  over the course of their daily activities. Even
                  within this highly socially structured species,
                  movement decisions emerged via a shared
                  process. Thus, democracy may be an inherent trait of
                  collective behavior.Science, this issue
                  p. 1358Conflicts of interest about where to go and
                  what to do are a primary challenge of group
                  living. However, it remains unclear how consensus is
                  achieved in stable groups with stratified social
                  relationships. Tracking wild baboons with a
                  high-resolution global positioning system and
                  analyzing their movements relative to one another
                  reveals that a process of shared decision-making
                  governs baboon movement. Rather than preferentially
                  following dominant individuals, baboons are more
                  likely to follow when multiple initiators
                  agree. When conflicts arise over the direction of
                  movement, baboons choose one direction over the
                  other when the angle between them is large, but they
                  compromise if it is not. These results are
                  consistent with models of collective motion,
                  suggesting that democratic collective action
                  emerging from simple rules is widespread, even in
                  complex, socially stratified societies.},

  abstract =	 "Foraging is a common benchmark problem in collective
                  robotics in which a robot (the forager) explores a
                  given environment while collecting items for further
                  deposition at specific locations. A typical
                  real-world application of foraging is garbage
                  collection where robots collect garbage for further
                  disposal in pre-defined locations. This work
                  proposes a method to cooperatively perform the task
                  of finding such locations: instead of using local or
                  global localization strategies relying on
                  pre-installed infrastructure, the proposed approach
                  takes advantage of the knowledge gathered by a
                  population about the localization of the targets. In
                  our approach, robots communicate in an intrinsic way
                  the estimation about how near they are from a
                  target; these estimations are used by neighbour
                  robots for estimating their proximity, and for

@Article{SUPR:11,
  abstract =	 {Foraging is a common benchmark problem in collective
                  robotics in which a robot (the forager) explores a
                  given environment while collecting items for further
                  deposition at specific locations. A typical
                  real-world application of foraging is garbage
                  collection where robots collect garbage for further
                  disposal in pre-defined locations.  This work
                  proposes a method to cooperatively perform the task
                  of finding such locations: instead of using local or
                  global localization strategies relying on
                  pre-installed infrastructure, the proposed approach
                  takes advantage of the knowledge gathered by a
                  population about the localization of the targets. In
                  our approach, robots communicate in an intrinsic way
                  the estimation about how near they are from a
                  target; these estimations are used by neighbour
                  robots for estimating their proximity, and for
                  guiding the navigation of the whole population when
                  looking for these specific areas. We performed
                  several tests in a simulator, and we validated our
                  approach on a population of real robots. For the
                  validation tests we used a mobile robot called
                  marXbot. In both cases (i.e., simulation and

  abstract =	 "The control of robot swarming in a distributed
                  manner is a difficult problem because global
                  behaviors must emerge as a result of many local
                  actions. This paper uses a bio-inspired control
                  method called the Digital Hormone Model (DHM) to
                  control the tasking and executing of robot swarms
                  based on local communication, signal propagation,
                  and stochastic reactions. The DHM model is
                  probabilistic, dynamic, fault-tolerant,
                  computationally efficient, and can be easily tasked
                  to change global behavior. Different from most
                  existing distributed control and learning
                  mechanisms, DHM considers the topological structure
                  of the organization, supports dynamic
                  reconfiguration and self-organization, and requires
                  no globally unique identifiers for individual
                  robots. The paper describes the DHM and presents the
                  experimental results on simulating biological
                  observations in the forming of feathers, and
                  simulating wireless communicated swarm behavior at a
                  large scale for attacking target, forming sensor

                  periodically form highly destructive plagues
                  responsible for billions of dollars in crop losses
                  in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and
                  Australia. These locusts usually exist in the
                  so-called solitarious behavioral phase and seek
                  isolation; gregarious individuals, however, are
                  attracted to conspecifics. Previous experimental
                  work has uncovered the causes of phase change in
                  individual insects: principally, sustained exposure
                  to sparse or crowded conditions. An open problem is
                  to understand the intrinsic roles that phase change
                  and social interaction play in the transition from
                  an initially disperse, solitarious population to an
                  aggregated, destructive marching hopper band of
                  gregarious individuals. To this end, we construct a
                  mathematical model that describes the interplay of
                  phase change and spatial dynamics. Through analysis
                  and numerical simulations, we determine a critical
                  density threshold for gregarious band formation and
                  quantify the collective phase change over time. We
                  also discuss implications of our work for
                  preventative management strategies and for possible
                  future biological experiments.</p>},

  abstract =	 {Recently, control and coordination of a set of
                  autonomous mobile robots has been paid a lot of
                  attentions, because the cooperation of simple robots
                  offers several advantages, such as redundancy and
                  flexibility, and allows performing hard tasks that
                  could be impossible for one single robot. There are
                  a lot of interesting applications of multiple
                  robots, such as satellite exploration and
                  surveillance missions. The characteristic of
                  simplicity of mobile robots brings potential wide
                  applications; however this characteristic also lead
                  to crash with higher probability during cooperation,
                  especially in harsh environment. Surprisingly, only
                  few researches consider the fault tolerance of
                  mobile robots, especially for dynamic coordination
                  application--- robot flocking. In this paper, we
                  summarize the existed flocking algorithms and
                  discuss their characteristics. Then we briefly
                  described our fault tolerant flocking algorithms in
                  different models. Finally we proposed the potential
                  future research directions for dynamic flocking of a
                  group of mobile robots. In all, this work can
                  provide a good reference for the researchers working
                  on dynamic cooperation of robots in distributed
                  system. },

                  in beautiful ways that both captivate and intrigue
                  the observer. Previous work has shown that starlings
                  pay attention to their seven closest neighbors, but
                  until now it was not understood why this number is
                  seven. Our paper explains the mystery: when
                  uncertainty in sensing is present, interacting with
                  six or seven neighbors optimizes the balance between
                  group cohesiveness and individual effort. To prove
                  this result we develop a new systems-theoretic
                  approach for understanding noisy consensus
                  dynamics. The approach allows the evaluation of
                  robustness over a family of hypothesized sensing
                  strategies using observations of the spatial
                  positions of birds within the flock. We apply this
                  approach to experimental data from wild starling
                  flocks, and find that six or seven neighbors yield
                  maximal robustness. The implication that robustness
                  of cohesion may have been a factor in the evolution
                  of flocking has significant consequences for
                  evolutionary biology. In addition, the results and
                  the versatility of the approach have implications
                  for uncertainty management in social and
                  technological networks.</p>},
